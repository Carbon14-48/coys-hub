            <h3>Passion</h3>
            <p>
              Football is more than a game at Tottenham — it’s a way of life.
              Our passion burns in the chants from the terraces, the dedication
              of our players, and the hope carried by every fan across the
              globe. It’s the spark that ignites dreams, drives our ambition,
              and fuels our relentless pursuit of greatness. Win or lose, our
              passion never fades.

            <h3>Pride</h3>
            <p>
              From the roar of the crowd to the wave of the Lilywhite flag,
              pride runs deep in every heartbeat of Tottenham Hotspur. It’s the
              unshakable belief in our club, our players, and our identity.
              Whether under the floodlights or on a rainy afternoon, we stand
              together — united in colors, united in purpose. Pride is not just
              what we feel; it’s who we are

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Our journey began in 1882, and since then, Tottenham Hotspur has
              carved its name into football’s storybooks. From legendary cup
              runs to unforgettable European nights, history is our foundation
              and our inspiration. Every trophy lifted, every iconic goal
              scored, and every chant sung tells a tale of resilience, glory,
              and moments that live forever in the hearts of our supporters.
